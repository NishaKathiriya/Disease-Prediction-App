# Disease Prediction Web Application

This **Disease Prediction Web Application** uses an XGBoost model to predict potential diseases based on user-input health metrics. Built using Python, Streamlit, and Scikit-learn, this app allows users to input specific medical features like blood metrics, glucose levels, and blood pressure, then instantly generates disease predictions based on the provided data.

**Key Features:**
- Intuitive, user-friendly interface using Streamlit.
- Inputs for various health metrics, such as Glucose, Hemoglobin, Cholesterol, and more.
- Instant prediction with a trained XGBoost model, providing users with a probable diagnosis.
- Model and label encoder saved as `.pkl` files to ensure efficient deployment.

**Technical Highlights:**
- Machine Learning model: XGBoost classifier.
- Model performance evaluation through precision, recall, and F1 score metrics.
- Data preprocessing and encoding ensure accuracy and usability.
